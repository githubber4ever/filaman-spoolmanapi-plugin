# Spoolman API Plugin for FilaMan

A FilaMan plugin that exposes a fully Spoolman-compatible REST API, allowing external tools like **Moonraker**, **OctoPrint** and others to use FilaMan as a drop-in replacement for Spoolman. Unlike Spoolman itself, this plugin includes IP-based access control — letting you restrict which devices are allowed to reach the API.

## Features

- Full Spoolman API v1 compatibility (all endpoints)
- Vendor, Filament and Spool CRUD operations
- Query filtering, sorting and pagination
- NFC/RFID tag linking for spools, lookup and scan relay for readers
- CSV and JSON export
- IP-based access control (a security layer missing in Spoolman)
- Admin UI for managing the IP allowlist

## Installation

Copy the `spoolmanapi/` folder into your FilaMan plugins directory and restart FilaMan.

## Configuration

### Moonraker

```ini
[spoolman]
server: http://<filaman-host>:8000/spoolman
```

### IP Access Control

By default, all IPs are allowed. To restrict access, open the plugin settings page in the FilaMan admin panel under **Spoolman API** and configure the IP allowlist.

The plugin accepts `extra.card_uids` as a comma-separated string and translates it to/from the
spool tag API without retaining it as a custom field. Native spool RFID tags take precedence.

## API

All Spoolman endpoints are available under:

```
http://<filaman-host>:8000/spoolman/api/v1/
```
